# BRK-stocks

Summary

We are analyzing stock data using 30 stocks from Dow Jones.  We want the user to be able to choose a stock and see visualizations about that stock (i.e. rate of change btw open and close, best day of the week/year to trade, top 5 days of the year to trade, changes in volume)

Current Tasks

Roman - Put CSVs into database (MySQL)
Bryan - create flask app skeleton
Katherine - Take CSV files and experiment with charting (use matplotlib, plotly.js, d3, etc)
