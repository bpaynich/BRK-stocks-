# BRK-stocks

<strong>Summary</strong>

We are analyzing stock data using 30 stocks from Dow Jones.  We want the user to be able to choose a stock and see visualizations about that stock (i.e. rate of change btw open and close, best day of the week/year to trade, top 5 days of the year to trade, changes in volume)

<strong>Current Tasks</strong>

Roman - Put CSVs into database (MySQL)<br/>
Bryan - create flask app skeleton<br/>
Katherine - Take CSV files and experiment with charting (use matplotlib, plotly.js, d3, etc)<br/>
